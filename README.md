I recycle it for my own needs and fix the errors that I encounter when using it.


Recycling plan:

[x] Ð¡orrect the design of the code for your own convenience

[ ] Correct the design of the code to comply with the agreement from Microsoft's C# Coding Conventions ([link](https://github.com/mrrogercampbell/microsoft-codecamp-lecture-notes/blob/main/resources/microsofts-csharp-coding-conventions.md))

[ ] Try adding tests


Fixed:

[x] Reworking of EventBus to eliminate errors in accessing lists
